# The dotfiles :tm:

If you gaze into the dotfile, the dotfile gazes also into you.

## Installing

You will need `git` and GNU `stow`

Clone into your `$HOME` directory or `~`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michealcarac/dotfiles.git
```

Run `stow` to symlink everything or just select what you want

```bash
stow */ # Everything (the '/' ignores the README)
```

or

```bash
stow zsh # My ZSH config
```

Install appropriate fonts to `$HOME/.fonts` (Pulls down Awesome Fonts 4 and 6)

```bash
installFonts.sh
```

## Programs

All current used programs are listed in the `programs` directory


Work in Progress.
Constantly Updating!
